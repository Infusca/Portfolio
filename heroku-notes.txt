DEPLOYING WITH HEROKU
0. settings.py -> make sure DEBUG is set to False
    -> make sure ALLOWED_HOSTS is set to heroku app domain:
        ie. ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['https://coding-portfolio-3d0c3b2282c9.herokuapp.com/']
    -> make sure STATIC_ROOT is set:
        ie. STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
1. log into heroku (browser)
    -> create app in browser
2. initialize git repo (git init), or update current repo
3. heroku git:remote -a name-of-heroku-app
4. deploy app -> commit code to repo and deploy it to Heroku using Git
    git add .
    git commit -am "..."
    git push heroku main

heroku apps -> get list of herkou apps
heroku info --app name-of-app -> get info on app including domain

So also to get this to work i needed to do the following:

pip install gunicorn -> a WSGI http server for python web apps
- add it to requirements.txt
create Procfile: (no extension; in folder with manage.py)
    web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi --log-file - (project-name should be the folder with settings.py)
    
heroku run bash -> get in bash shell to see file setup of heroku
heroku run python app/manage.py migrate (otherwise heroku is looking for app/manage.py instead of app/app/manage.py)

still wasn't working but closer...
